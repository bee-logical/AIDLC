# /aidlc:release — cut a release

Releases are prepared autonomously but EXECUTED behind approval: `gh release create` /
`az pipelines run` sit in the `ask` permission list by design.

**Releases are per-repo.** Each repo versions, tags and publishes on its own cadence from its own
history. `$ARGUMENTS` names the target repo (`/aidlc:release <repo>`); with a single repo (mono)
it's implied. A coordinated workspace release = run the steps below **once per repo** (sequentially,
respecting `dependsOn`: a consuming repo releases after the API it depends on), each with its own
tag and notes — there is no shared cross-repo version. Every git/gh/az command runs with cwd =
`workspace.root`/`<repo.path>` and that repo's `host`/`remote`/`defaultBranch`.

## 1 · Version decision (semver from conventional commits)

`git log <last-tag>..HEAD --pretty=%s` →
any `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE` → **major** · any `feat:` → **minor** · else `fix:`/`chore:`/... → **patch**.
Pre-1.0: breaking → minor, everything else → patch. State the decision and the commits that drove it.

## 2 · Changelog

Group commits under Added (`feat`) / Fixed (`fix`) / Changed (`refactor`, `perf`) — user
language, not commit-speak; fold multiple commits per work item into one line with the item ID.
Skip `chore/test/docs` unless user-visible. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the new version +
date; bump `package.json` version (and lockfile via `npm install --package-lock-only`).

## 3 · Release commit + tag (needs a normal run/PR unless on a release branch flow)

`chore(release): v{X.Y.Z}` → tag `v{X.Y.Z}` annotated with the changelog section.

## 4 · Publish (requires human approval)

- GitHub: `gh release create v{X.Y.Z} --title "v{X.Y.Z}" --notes-file <section>` (add `--generate-notes` only if the repo has no changelog discipline).
- Azure: push the tag; if a release pipeline exists, `az pipelines run` (approval-gated).
- **Local mode** (`git.mode: local`, no remote): there is nothing to publish to. Create the
  annotated tag locally (`git tag -a v{X.Y.Z} -m "<changelog section>"`) and STOP there — report the
  tag and note that a hosted release/`gh release create` will run once a remote is configured. Never
  push or invent a remote.
- Never `npm publish` / `docker push` without explicit instruction — they're separate approvals.

## Release notes style

Lead with the 1–3 changes users care about, in their words. Then the grouped list with work-item
links. Call out breaking changes FIRST with a migration line each. No commit hashes in the prose.
